476. Number Complement
Easy

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
    integer.  You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
    representation.  This question is the same as 1009:
